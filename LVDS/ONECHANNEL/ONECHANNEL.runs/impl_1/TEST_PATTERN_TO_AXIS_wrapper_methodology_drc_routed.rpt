Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock TEST_PATTERN_TO_AXIS_i/LVDS_to_AXIS_0/inst/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#2 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock TEST_PATTERN_TO_AXIS_i/clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#3 Critical Warning
