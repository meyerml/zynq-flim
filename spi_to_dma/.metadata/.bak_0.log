This flag is asserted when:   The core is configured in dual/quad SPI mode and   The first entry in the SPI DTR FIFO (after reset) does not match with the supported command list for particular memory. When the SPI command in DTR FIFO does not match with the internal supported command list, the core completes the SPI transactions in standard SPI format. This bit is set to show this behavior of the core.
In standard SPI mode this bit is always in default state.
